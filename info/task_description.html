You often work with the different geometrical figures and with their parameters - perimeter, area, volume. You are tired to do this by hand, so you have decided to automate this process. You should write the program for this. In this program you should create the class Parameters which will choose one of the few figures (circle, right triangle, square, right pentagon, right hexagon, cube) using method <strong>choose_figure()</strong> and will count the perimeter, area and volume using those methods:<br>
<br>
<strong>perimeter()</strong> - returns the perimeter of the figure<br>
<strong>area()</strong> - returns the area of the figure<br>
<strong>volume()</strong> - returns the volume of the figure<br>
<br>
Also you have to create a class for each figure and use <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern'>Strategy</a> design pattern to solve this mission.<br>
Every figure except cube has volume = 0.<br>
If the result has no decimal part you should return it as int(), in the other case - round it to 2 decimal sign.

<strong>Examples</strong>:
<pre class="brush: python">
figure = Parameters(10)
    
figure.choose_figure(Circle())
figure.area() == 314.16

figure.choose_figure(Triangle())
figure.perimeter() == 30

figure.choose_figure(Square())
figure.area() == 100

figure.choose_figure(Pentagon())
figure.perimeter() == 50

figure.choose_figure(Hexagon())
figure.perimeter() == 60

figure.choose_figure(Cube())
figure.volume() == 1000
</pre>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong>Statements and expression of the classes.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong>perimeter, area, volume (number).
